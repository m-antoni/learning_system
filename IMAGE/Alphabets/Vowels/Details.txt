What Are Vowels?
The letters A, E, I, O, and U are called vowels. The other letters in the alphabet are called consonants.

A vowel is classified as a speech sound produced by a comparatively open configuration of the vocal tract, with vibration of the vocal cords but without audible friction. 

A vowel sound (but not necessarily a vowel in the actual spelling) will be present in a syllable.


consonant
A consonant is a speech sound that is not a vowel. It also refers to letters of the alphabet that represent
 those sounds: Z, B, T, G, and H are all consonants.
Consonants are all the non-vowel sounds, or their corresponding letters: A, E, I, O, U and sometimes 
Y are not consonants. In hat, H and T are consonants. Consonant can also be an adjective that describes
 things that seem like they should go together, things that are "agreeable." You could say a nation's 
offer of aid is consonant with their treaties. When you hear consonant sounds in music, they are 
pleasing, the opposite of "dissonant" sounds which are harsh.
